# AI-ML-Project
DEEP LEARNING PROJECT FASHION MNIST CLASSIFICATION
## Objective

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning related to artificial neural networks. The word "deep" refers to the use of larger neural networks with many hidden units. Deep learning's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be state-of-the-art techniques for image recognition tasks. Keras, a deep learning library in Python, provides an interface for creating artificial neural networks and is built on top of TensorFlow.

The primary objective of this project is to implement a CNN to perform image classification on the famous Fashion MNIST dataset. This project will be divided into three main steps: data analysis, model training, and prediction.

## Methodology

### Training the First Neural Network Model

Training a Neural Network (NN) involves the following four steps:

1. **Build the Architecture**
2. **Compile the Model**
3. **Train the Model**
4. **Evaluate the Model**
